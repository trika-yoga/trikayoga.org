The phenomenal universe emerges from Wholeness not as a separate creation but as the spontaneous expression of divine fullness - like waves arising from the ocean while remaining essentially oceanic.</p><p>The profound paradox presented here - that taking wholeness from wholeness leaves wholeness intact - points to the non-dual nature of Reality. In the supreme recognition, creation does not diminish the creator, manifestation does not fragment the absolute, and multiplicity does not compromise unity. This is the heart of divine play (<em>līlā</em>) where infinite consciousness appears as infinite forms while never departing from its essential nature.</p><p>The verse thus serves as both philosophical declaration and meditative contemplation, inviting the practitioner to recognize their own inherent wholeness as non-separate from the cosmic Wholeness itself.</p><h3 id="books" tabindex="-1">Books <a class="header-anchor" href="#books" aria-label="Permalink to “Books”">​</a></h3><p><a href="/books/SwamiDayanandaEng.pdf">Commentary on Purnamadah Purnamidam by Swami Dayananda Saraswati</a></p>',7))])}const v=o(d,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,v as default};
