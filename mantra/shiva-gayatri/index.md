This sacred _gāyatrī_ to Śiva employs the classical tri-pada structure while invoking the supreme reality through three of his most profound epithets. The mantra establishes a complete contemplative movement from recognition through meditation to divine inspiration.

_Tatpuruṣa_ designates the cosmic Person (_puruṣa_) who is simultaneously "That" (_tat_) — the transcendent absolute — and the intimate Self dwelling in all beings. This is Śiva in his fourth aspect within the _pañcabrahma_, governing the concealing function (_tirodhāna_) that allows the One to appear as many without losing unity.

_Mahādeva_ reveals the Great God (_mahā-deva_) whose greatness (_mahatva_) lies not in power over creation but in being the very consciousness (_deva_ from _div_ "to shine") in which all experience arises. The term _dhīmahi_ indicates not ordinary thinking but the profound meditative absorption (_dhyāna_) wherein individual consciousness recognizes its essential identity with cosmic consciousness.

The concluding prayer — _tan no rudraḥ pracodayāt_ — invokes Rudra's inspiring power (_pracodanā_) not as external blessing but as the awakening of our own inherent wisdom-nature. _Rudra_ as "the roaring one" represents the dynamic aspect of Śiva that dissolves all limiting concepts and reveals the natural state of unlimited awareness.

This _gāyatrī_ thus serves as both devotional practice and direct pointing (_pratyabhijñā_) toward the recognition of our essential nature as Śiva-consciousness itself.
