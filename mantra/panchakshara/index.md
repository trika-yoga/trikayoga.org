ॐ नमः शिवाय {sans big}

om namaḥ śivāya {trans}

**Salutations to the Auspicious One**

::: stanza

### Primary Interpretations:

- **Jñāni's Understanding**: The word "**namaḥ**" (नमः) signifies the limited individual soul (jīva, जिव). The word "**śiva**" (शिव) denotes the Universal Spirit (Paramātman). The suffix "**ya**" (य) indicates the essential identity between Jīva and Paramātman. The syllable **Om** (ॐ) symbolizes the dissolution of **Māyā** — the cosmic illusion.

- **Bhakti's Understanding**: The syllable "**om**" (ॐ) means "all existence, animate and inanimate." The word "namaḥ" (नमः) derives from "**na mama**" (न मम) — "not mine," "not for me." The word "**śivāya**" (शिवाय) means "unto Śiva." The complete mantra thus declares: All of this universe, both living and non-living, belongs not to me and exists not for my sake, but for Śiva alone.

Though it bears the direct translation **Salutations to the Auspicious One**, its essential meaning transcends mere words, residing in the sacred sounds that compose it. These five syllables correspond to the five primordial elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ākāśa) and to Śiva's cosmic form as **Pañcamukha** or **Pañcānana** — the [Lord] bearing Five Faces, each governing a fundamental aspect of creation, preservation, dissolution, concealment, and grace. {eng}
