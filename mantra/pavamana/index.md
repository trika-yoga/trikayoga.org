ॐ असतोमा सद्गमय ।

Oṁ asato mā śad gamaya ।  
Tamaso mā jyotir gamaya ।  
mṛtyor mā amṛtaṁ gamaya ।  
Oṁ śānti śāntiḥ śāntiḥ ॥ {trans}

Lead me from the unreal to the Real,  
Lead me from darkness to Light,  
Lead me from death to Immortality,  
Peace in body, Peace in mind, Peace in spirit.

::: stanza

This mantra from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad encapsulates the fundamental human spiritual aspiration across three existential dimensions:

- **Ontological**: From _asat_ (non-being, the phenomenal world of appearances) to _sat_ (pure Being, ultimate Reality)
- **Epistemological**: From _tamas_ (ignorance, spiritual darkness) to _jyoti_ (the Light of Knowledge, divine illumination)
- **Eschatological**: From _mṛtyu_ (mortality, the cycle of death and rebirth) to _amṛta_ (deathless state, liberation)

The threefold _śānti_ invocation at the end addresses peace across all planes of existence - _ādhyātmika_ (pertaining to the self/body), _ādhibhautika_ (pertaining to other beings/mind), and _ādhidaivika_ (pertaining to divine forces/spirit) - acknowledging that true peace must encompass every level of our being.

This is fundamentally a prayer of spiritual transformation, requesting divine guidance for the soul's journey from the conditioned state to ultimate liberation (_mokṣa_).
