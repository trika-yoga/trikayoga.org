Oṃ namaḥ śivāya gurave  
saccidānanda mūrtaye ।  
niṣprapañcāya śāntāya  
nirālambāya tejase ॥ {trans}

Oṃ. Homage _(namaḥ)_ to Śiva _(śivāya)_ as Guru _(gurave)_.
To the embodiment _(mūrtaye)_ of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss _(saccidānanda)_.
To the one beyond-phenomena _(niṣprapañcāya)_, to the peaceful _(śāntāya)_,
To the supportless _(nirālambāya)_, to the luminous _(tejase)_.

This profound invocation recognizes Śiva not merely as transcendent deity but as the immediate presence of the Guru-principle _(guruttva)_ — that self-luminous awareness through which all knowledge arises and recognition dawns.

The verse systematically reveals the Guru's essential nature. As _saccidānanda-mūrti_, the Guru manifests as the very form _(mūrti)_ of pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss, not possessing these qualities but being their living embodiment. The term _niṣprapañca_ indicates the Guru's nature as beyond all phenomenal appearances _(prapañca)_ — neither within the world of name-and-form nor separate from it, but as the awareness in which all appearances arise and dissolve.

_Śānta_ reveals the Guru as the peace that surpasses understanding — not the temporary quietude of mental stillness but the eternal rest _(viśrānti)_ of consciousness at ease in its own nature. _Nirālamba_ points to the self-sufficient nature of awareness that requires no external support _(ālamba)_ — it is the ground of all experience while remaining forever ungrounded itself.

Finally, _tejas_ designates the Guru as pure luminosity — the self-evident radiance of consciousness through which everything becomes known while itself remaining the eternal knower, never an object of knowledge.
