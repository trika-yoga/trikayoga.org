		"text": "The central channel (nadi) of the human energy system. It runs through the inner part of the spinal column, connecting with each of the chakras. Sushumna originates at the base of the spine (kanda), travels along the spinal cord, and ends at the crown of the head. Within it are three more subtle channels: Vajra-nadi (Vajrini-nadi), which is radiant like the Sun; pale Chitrini-nadi; and the even subtler Brahma-nadi, which shines with otherworldly brilliance. As Kundalini energy awakens, it ascends through Sushumna to the Sahasrara chakra, facilitating spiritual enlightenment and the realization of one's true nature."
